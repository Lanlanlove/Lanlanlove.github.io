# üßë‚Äçüéì About Me
+ I received the B.Eng degree in software engineering from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%94%B5%E5%AD%90%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/163947?fr=aladdin) in 2020. Then I received the Msc degree in advanced computer science in the [University of Manchester](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9B%BC%E5%BD%BB%E6%96%AF%E7%89%B9%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/2609100?fr=aladdin) in 2021.Now I am a Ph.D. student of [Fudan University](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%8D%E6%97%A6%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/111790?fr=aladdin), in [school of journalism](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/n1339/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Shaojing Sun](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/node2/fdxwxy/n1339/n1340/n1344/n1370/n1374/u1ai112772.html) and [Dr. Jingjing Han](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/node2/fdxwxy/n1339/n1340/n1344/n1370/n1374/u1ai115623.html).
+ My research interest includes **Human-computer communication, Media psychology, computational social science** and I have published my works in both SCI/SSCI journals and EI conferences in related areas.

[Identify Selective Forwarding Attacks Using Danger Model: Promote the Detection Accuracy in Wireless Sensor Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9755128)

**Xinyu Huang**, Yuanming Wu

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=cuDwCOwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=cuDwCOwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='cuDwCOwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'></span></strong>
- We proposed a multi-level detection scheme inspired by human immune system against selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. 
- The detection accuracy and the false alarm rate are much lower than other effective methods.
- We also reduced the computation complexity to $$O(n)$$.
