# üßë‚Äçüéì About Me
+ I received the B.Eng degree in optoelectronic information science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2023. Now I am a Ph.D. student of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in electronic engineering, supervised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/changtsunghui).
+ My research interest includes Internet of things, network security, wireless localization and machine learning, and I have published my works in *IEEE Sens.J. and IEEE IoT J., etc.* in related areas.

[Identify Selective Forwarding Attacks Using Danger Model: Promote the Detection Accuracy in Wireless Sensor Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9755128)

**Xinyu Huang**, Yuanming Wu

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=cuDwCOwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=cuDwCOwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='cuDwCOwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'></span></strong>
- We proposed a multi-level detection scheme inspired by human immune system against selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. 
- The detection accuracy and the false alarm rate are much lower than other effective methods.
- We also reduced the computation complexity to $$O(n)$$.
