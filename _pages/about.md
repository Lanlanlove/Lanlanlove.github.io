# üßë‚Äçüéì About Me
+ I received the B.Eng degree in Software Engineering from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%94%B5%E5%AD%90%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/163947?fr=aladdin) in 2020. Then I received the Msc degree in Advanced Computer Science in the [University of Manchester](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9B%BC%E5%BD%BB%E6%96%AF%E7%89%B9%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/2609100?fr=aladdin) in 2021.Now I am a Ph.D. student of [Fudan University](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%8D%E6%97%A6%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/111790?fr=aladdin), in [school of journalism](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/n1339/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Shaojing Sun](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/node2/fdxwxy/n1339/n1340/n1344/n1370/n1374/u1ai112772.html) and [Dr. Jingjing Han](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/node2/fdxwxy/n1339/n1340/n1344/n1370/n1374/u1ai115623.html).
+ My research interest includes **Human-computer communication, Media psychology, computational social science** and I have published my works in both SCI/SSCI journals and EI conferences in related areas.

--**Gong,C**, Jingjing Han. (2023). Brain Activation Shows AI Voice is Less Engaging than Human Voice. <i> 73rd Annual International Communication Association Conference </i> (ICA 2023)
- Brain activity responses were greater when listening to a human newscast than to an AI voice newscast. 
- Participants‚Äô brain were better at processing, understanding auditory information, and storing working memory when listening to a human reporter than when listening to a voice generated by AI.
- The human voice caused greater cognitive effect, which may reflect participants' trust in the credibility and fluency of the human voice news.

--**Gong,C** (2023). Who Stole My Memory? ‚Äî‚ÄîA Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review of ‚Äúthe Google Effect‚Äù. <i> 73rd Annual International Communication Association Conference </i>(ICA 2023)
- The "Google effect" refers to the idea that individuals rely on the Internet as a source of knowledge rather than remembering it for themselves. Humans may be less eager to answer inquiries willingly as a result of Internet access, preferring to utilise search engines instead.
- The behaviours were found to be closely associated with external memory storage databases. And this phenomenon is also more likely to happen while using a mobile phone to browse the Internet rather than a computer.
- People with a larger knowledge base are less susceptible to the consequences of internet use than those with a smaller knowledge base. ‚ÄúThe Google effect‚Äù was stronger for persons who had used the Internet before than for those who had not. ‚ÄúThe Google effect‚Äù varies by age, with children and the elderly being less affected by Internet search behaviour than adults, and the effect is less well defined in persons who lack Internet abilities or those who are older and have cognitive problems.

- A smart memory storage solution based on memory-enhanced embedded learning is constructed based on meta-learning under deep learning. 
- The results reveal that the solution based on deep learning has obvious effects on different datasets, with an average accuracy rate of 99.7%.
- The proposed elderly oriented smart device effectively reduces the shortcomings in the current market and lowers the learning difficulty, which provides an important reference for further enriching devices in the ageing market.
