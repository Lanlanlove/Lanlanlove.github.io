# üßë‚Äçüéì About Me
+ I received the B.Eng degree in Software Engineering from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%94%B5%E5%AD%90%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/163947?fr=aladdin) in 2020. Then I received the Msc degree in Advanced Computer Science in the [University of Manchester](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9B%BC%E5%BD%BB%E6%96%AF%E7%89%B9%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/2609100?fr=aladdin) in 2021.Now I am a Ph.D. student of [Fudan University](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%8D%E6%97%A6%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/111790?fr=aladdin), in [school of Journalism](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/n1339/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Shaojing Sun](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/node2/fdxwxy/n1339/n1340/n1344/n1370/n1374/u1ai112772.html) and [Dr. Jingjing Han](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/node2/fdxwxy/n1339/n1340/n1344/n1370/n1374/u1ai115623.html).
+ My research interest includes **Human-computer communication, Media psychology, Computational social science** and I have published my works in both SCI/SSCI journals and EI conferences in related areas.

- In this study, by carrying out meta-analysis, we found that google effects is closely associated with cognitive load, behavioral phenotype and cognitive self-esteem. And this phenomenon is also more likely to happen while using a mobile phone to browse the Internet rather than a computer.  
-  People with a larger knowledge base are less susceptible to the consequences of Internet use than those with a smaller knowledge base. The media effect was stronger for persons who had used the Internet before than for those who had not
- And meta-analyses show that participants in North America (parameter‚Äâ =‚Äâ‚àí1.0365, 95%CI‚Äâ =‚Äâ [‚àí1.8758, ‚àí0.1972], p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) are more susceptible to frequent Internet search behavior relative to other regions.

- Brain activity responses were greater when listening to a human newscast than to an AI voice newscast. 
- Participants‚Äô brain were better at processing, understanding auditory information, and storing working memory when listening to a human reporter than when listening to a voice generated by AI.
- The human voice caused greater cognitive effect, which may reflect participants' trust in the credibility and fluency of the human voice news.

--**Gong,C**., Ren, Y. (2023) PTSD, FOMO and fake news beliefs: a cross-sectional study of Wenchuan earthquake survivors. <i> BMC Public Health </i>, (**2022 SCI JCR Q2**).  [https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-17151-z](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-17151-z)
- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) sufferers show problematic patterns of Internet use such as fear of missing out (FOMO) and sharing misinformation and fake news. This study aimed to investigate these associations in survivors of the 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, China. 
- A self-reported survey was completed by 356 survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake. A mediated structural equation model was constructed to test a proposed pattern of associations with FOMO as a mediator of the relationship between PTSD symptoms and belief in fake news, as well as moderators of this pathway.
- Those with higher PTSD symptoms are more likely to believe fake news and this is partly explained by FOMO. This effect is present in females and not males and is stronger in older people. Findings extend knowledge of the role of psychological variables in problematic Internet use among those with PTSD.

- A smart memory storage solution based on memory-enhanced embedded learning is constructed based on meta-learning under deep learning. 
- The results reveal that the solution based on deep learning has obvious effects on different datasets, with an average accuracy rate of 99.7%.
- The proposed elderly oriented smart device effectively reduces the shortcomings in the current market and lowers the learning difficulty, which provides an important reference for further enriching devices in the ageing market.
